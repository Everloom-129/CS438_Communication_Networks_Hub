# Email for requesting the heatmap plan of sibel center

Dear Prof. Deepak and IT teams,

​	Thank you for your patience on our mini project!

​	 We are a team doing wireless network research at Thomas M.Siebel Center. Based on the knowledge we learned in CS438, we plan to investigate how different Access Point(AP) work, and draw a network heatmap for the whole building with our own designed tool. 

​	Downloaded the floor plan online, we tried to use the relative coordinate + signal strength to construct the heatmap. However, when we are collecting data around the building, we found two data are important to this mini project:

- The coordinate address and name for the APs
  - There are too much APs, it is hard to do localization. 
- The heatmap screen shot of your professional tools on Sibel Center.
  - This can be the ground truth for us to check our tool's performance. 

We would be very appreciate if you can help us to request these 2 data from the IT teams, which will be helpful for our project. 

​	Thanks again for today's valuable lecture, which solves many problems we encountered while completing the project. 

​	The proposal and floorplan pdf we have is attached, looking forward to your early reply!
