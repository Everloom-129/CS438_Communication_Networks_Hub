Dear UIUC Technology Services Team,

I hope this email finds you well. 

My name is Tony Wang, a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign currently enrolled in the CS438 course. Our group is working on a mini-project titled "Wireless Network Optimization through Signal Strength Measurement and Analysis at Thomas M. Siebel Center." The main goal of our project is to analyze the signal strength of Wi-Fi and LTE networks within the Thomas M. Siebel Center, create coverage maps, and identify areas with poor network performance. 

In order to better understand the wireless network infrastructure and gain more accurate insights, we would like to know if there are any official network access-related APIs available for our research. Having access to such APIs would greatly enhance the quality and depth of our analysis, ultimately leading to better optimization suggestions.

Additionally, we would appreciate the opportunity to discuss our project proposal with you in person. Your expertise and insights would be invaluable in guiding us towards a more effective approach to network analysis and optimization. We believe that our project could contribute positively to the overall wireless network performance at the Thomas M. Siebel Center and improve the user experience for students, faculty, and staff.

Please let us know if you have any available APIs, the necessary steps to access them, and any guidelines we should follow. Moreover, we would be grateful if you could suggest a suitable time for a meeting or discussion to further explore our project's potential and gather your valuable feedback.

Thank you for your attention and support. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Tony Wang
