-	Developed an open-source, Python tool for comprehensive wireless network analysis, focusing on Wi-Fi access points roaming mechanisms and signal strength heatmap generation. 
-	Designed a procedure-oriented data pipeline architecture including coordinate construction, data collection, data preprocessing, heatmap generation, and individual AP analysis.
-	Analyzed campus AP roaming machanisms and generated heatmap of UIUC Thomas M. Siebel Center, and proposed report for UIUC real-world network environment via collaborating with UIUC IT Network team.
