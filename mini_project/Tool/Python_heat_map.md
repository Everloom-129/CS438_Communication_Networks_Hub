# Python-based Wifi network heatmap construction

## Background:

- **Data Collection:** Utilize WiFi and LTE Analyzer Apps to measure signal strength, network performance, the AP or cell tower connected and other relevant parameters at various locations within the CS_Building
- **Network Heat Map Creation:** Create a heat map of the CS_Building using NetSpot and other open-source software, highlighting areas with strong, moderate, and weak signal strength. Identify any dead zones or areas with high network interference. 
- **Current Resource**: 
  - Floor plan of CS_Building
  - Phone and laptop used to collect data



## Input Data: 

To be decided 



## Output form:

- Heatmap Graph, showing the strength of network within a floor of CS_Building



## Objective:

First, provide an architecture of the project, including the necessary library, and open-source code. 

Don't write any specific code
