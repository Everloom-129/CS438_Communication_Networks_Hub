# Python-based Wifi network heatmap construction

## Background:

- **Data Collection:** Utilize WiFi and LTE Analyzer Apps to measure signal strength, network performance, the AP or cell tower connected and other relevant parameters at various locations within the CS_Building
- **Network Heat Map Creation:** Create a heat map of the CS_Building using NetSpot and other open-source software, highlighting areas with strong, moderate, and weak signal strength. Identify any dead zones or areas with high network interference. 
- **Current Resource**: 
  - Floor plan of CS_Building
  - Phone and laptop used to collect data



## Input Data: 

To be decided 



## Output form:

- Heatmap Graph, showing the strength of network within a floor of CS_Building



## Objective:

First, provide an architecture of the project, including the necessary library, and open-source code. 

Don't write any specific code

8. `move` - Move or rename a file or directory
9. `type` - Display the contents of a file
10. `find` - Search for a specific string in a file
11. `tasklist` - Display information about running processes
12. `taskkill` - Terminate a running process
13. `netstat` - Display network connections and listening ports
14. `ping` - Test network connectivity to a server
15. `ipconfig` - Display network configuration information
16. `systeminfo` - Display system configuration information
17. `whoami` - Display the current user name and security identifier
18. `powercfg` - Configure power settings
19. `chkdsk` - Check and repair file system errors
20. `help` - Display help information about a command.

Note that Windows PowerShell, which is an advanced command-line tool included in Windows, provides a more powerful and flexible command-line experience than the traditional command prompt.
