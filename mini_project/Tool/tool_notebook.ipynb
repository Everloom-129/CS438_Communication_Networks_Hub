    "Heatmap Generation\n",
    "Visualization\n",
    "1. Data Collection\n",
    "Use a Wi-Fi and LTE Analyzer App like Wi-Fi Analyzer (Android) or Airport Utility (iOS) to gather signal strength, network performance, and other relevant parameters.\n",
    "While collecting data, ensure that you note down the (x, y) coordinates of the locations within the CS_Building floor plan.\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Libraries: pandas, numpy\n",
    "Process the collected data and convert it into a structured format (e.g., CSV file).\n",
    "Read the CSV file using pandas and preprocess the data. Remove any outliers, fill missing values, and normalize the signal strength values if necessary.\n",
    "3. Heatmap Generation\n",
    "Libraries: scipy, numpy, matplotlib\n",
    "Use the spatial data (coordinates) and signal strength data to interpolate the Wi-Fi signal strength across the entire floor plan.\n",
    "You can use interpolation methods such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) or Radial Basis Function (RBF) available in the scipy library.\n",
    "The interpolated data will then be used to generate a heatmap.\n",
    "4. Visualization\n",
    "Libraries: matplotlib, seaborn\n",
    "Overlay the heatmap on the CS_Building floor plan using matplotlib and seaborn.\n",
    "Use a color scale to indicate signal strength (e.g., green for strong, yellow for moderate, and red for weak).\n",
    "Highlight any dead zones or areas with high network interference.\n",
    "Save the generated heatmap as an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG).\n",
    "Open-source Code\n",
    "Use the existing open-source code for heatmap generation and visualization as a starting point.\n",
    "You can find examples and tutorials on GitHub, Stack Overflow, or other online resources.\n",
    "Make sure to adapt the code to suit your specific data format and requirements.\n",
    "Once you have set up the project architecture, you can start implementing the individual components and fine-tune them based on your collected data and desired heatmap output."
