Brief summary of the project, its goals, methodology, and main findings.

This project entailed a comprehensive analysis of wireless network performance within the Thomas M. Siebel Center, with the overarching aim of identifying opportunities for network optimization. Our investigation centered around measuring the signal strength of both WiFi and LTE networks within the building, generating detailed coverage maps, and pinpointing areas with subpar network performance. We utilized WiFi and LTE Analyzer Apps for data collection, processing the gathered data to map network coverage and identify patterns in network performance. Our analysis extended to studying network performance variability over different times of day and days of the week, exploring the correlation between signal strength and network performance parameters, and investigating the nuances of Access Point (AP) switching. The project also delved into user localization, with the intent to understand user density across the campus and the implications for network performance. Our findings have yielded valuable insights into the current state of the Siebel Center's wireless network and have informed a set of robust recommendations for network infrastructure enhancements. These proposed improvements are expected to enhance network performance and user experience while ensuring more efficient use of network resources. This project lays a foundation for future network planning and optimization initiatives on campus.
