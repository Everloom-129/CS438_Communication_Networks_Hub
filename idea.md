- Satellite Network Performance Analysis:
Investigate the performance of satellite networks by comparing them to traditional terrestrial networks (e.g., fiber, LTE). Collect data on satellite network providers like Starlink, OneWeb, or HughesNet, and measure metrics like latency, throughput, and packet loss. Compare these metrics to terrestrial networks and analyze the trade-offs between them.

- Satellite Network Ground Station Placement Optimization:
Develop an algorithm or tool to optimize the placement of ground stations for a satellite network. This can involve factors like minimizing the distance between ground stations and satellites, accounting for terrain and land availability, and minimizing signal attenuation due to weather conditions. You can use geospatial libraries like GDAL or GeoPandas in Python for spatial data processing.

- Satellite Network Security Analysis:
Analyze the security of satellite networks by simulating various attacks like jamming, eavesdropping, and signal interception. Investigate the security measures used by satellite network providers, such as encryption and frequency hopping, and propose additional countermeasures to improve network security. Use tools like GNU Radio, Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), or HackRF for software-defined radio (SDR) experimentation.



### Replicate any exprienment?
While it may not be possible to replicate a classic satellite experiment in its entirety due to the complexity and costs involved, you can explore certain aspects of satellite communication by simulating or emulating parts of the system. Here are a few ideas for experiments related to satellite communication that you can consider:

1. Signal Propagation and Attenuation:
Study the effects of signal propagation and attenuation in satellite communication systems. You can use software-defined radio (SDR) tools like GNU Radio or MATLAB to simulate satellite communication links and investigate the impact of factors like atmospheric conditions, rain, and foliage on signal strength and quality.

2. Orbital Mechanics:
Explore the fundamentals of orbital mechanics and satellite motion by simulating satellite orbits using tools like STK (Systems Tool Kit) or GMAT (General Mission Analysis Tool). Analyze different orbital parameters and their impact on satellite coverage, revisit time, and ground track patterns.

3. Satellite Link Budget Analysis:
Perform a link budget analysis for a satellite communication system, taking into account factors like antenna gain, transmitter power, path loss, and receiver sensitivity. You can use tools like Excel, MATLAB, or Python to calculate the link budget and study the impact of different parameters on the overall system performance.

4. Error Correction Techniques:
Investigate the use of error correction techniques in satellite communication systems, such as Reed-Solomon codes, convolutional codes, or Turbo codes. You can use MATLAB, Python, or other programming languages to implement and analyze the performance of these error correction techniques in a simulated satellite communication channel.

5. Emulate Satellite Network Delay and Latency:
Using network emulation tools like NetEm or WANem, emulate the delay and latency characteristics of satellite networks in a local network environment. Test various applications and protocols, such as VoIP, video streaming, and file transfer, under these conditions and analyze their performance.

These experiments can provide valuable insights into various aspects of satellite communication and help you gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and solutions in this field. Before starting any experiment, make sure to discuss your idea with your instructor or TA to ensure it meets the course requirements.
